### How do I get started with Python?

If you are very new to the Python programming language, we encourage you to work through some of the resources listed here.  The team at the HackWeek will be happy to continue teaching you and discuss any questions you may have, but you will get much more out of the week if you have the basics of the language under your belt when you arrive.

* The [Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation) introductory tutorial developed by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) starts from the basics but uses a scientific data analysis task to motivate all ideas, so it's a great way to learn the language if you are a sciencist.

* Jake VanderPlas wrote an excellent [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) that covers the core language and is also particularly well suited to scientific audiences.

* The [Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org) is always a useful reference to be aware of; in particular its [introductory tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is well written.


**Note:** these are resources specific to the core language itself. Python is a broad-spectrum language used in a wide range of problem domains.  In the next section we'll provide you with introductory information regarding its use for scientific data analysis and computation.
